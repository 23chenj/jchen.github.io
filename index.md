### CPSC 120

Lab 3

Lab 3, part 1, was definitely one of my preferred of the labs that we did.  For the simple reason that it was a good introduction to the field, considering that this is the first programming class that I have taken.  It allowed me a better understanding of the process and more basic functions that we utilized throughout the rest of the semester.

Lab 5

Lab 5, part 1, was also another of my preferred labs.  I wouldn't say that I particularly enjoyed this lab, rather I learned a great deal from it.  It was extremely challenging for me and I definitely struggled to complete it, but for this reason I believe it was beneficial to me and my partner.

Lab 12

Lab 12, part 1, would be my last choice as it was challenging but also very satisfying to complete the lab.  Seeing what code could do as far as creating animaed gradients and observing how small changes in the code could alter the final image was extremely interesting.  It was also very rewarding to know that the semester was over and all the labs were completed.
